# Analysis-of-Ecommerce-Company

Ecommerce Clothing Market is very big and at the same time, emerging. Nowadays, people prefer online shopping rather than visiting the stores. We analyzed the Google Merchandise Store data for our project. For our analysis, we have considered Quarter 1 of year 2019. First, we identified the key business objectives of an ecommerce clothing company and the success metrics that affect these objectives.

Secondly, using Google Analytics, we identified the trends, plotted pie charts, bar graphs for the chosen Key Performance Indicators and identified the issues. We plotted the Revenue Waterfall model which tells us how Revenue over a year is affected due to Conversions, Visits and Average Order Value. 

Finally, we recommended some feasible steps that can be taken by the company in order to increase it's year over year revenue.
